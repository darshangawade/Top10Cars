<p>The Austin-Healey 3000 is a British sports car built from 1959 to 1967. It is the best known of the "big Healey" models. The car's bodywork was made by Jensen Motors and the vehicles were assembled at BMC's (The British Motor Corporation Limited ) MG Works in Abingdon, alongside the corporation's MG ( M.G. Car Company Limited ) models. </p>
<p>The 3-litre 3000 was a highly successful car, which won its class in many European rallies in its heyday and is still raced in classic car competitions.The Austin-Healey 3000 was announced on 1 July 1959 with a 3-litre BMC C-Series engine to replace the smaller 2.6-litre engine of the 100-6 and disc brakes for its front wheels. The manufacturers claimed it would reach 60 mph in 11 seconds and 100 mph in 31 seconds </p>

<p>The Jaguar E-Type, or the Jaguar XK-E for the North American market, is a British sports car that was manufactured by Jaguar Cars Ltd between 1961 and 1975. Its combination of beauty, high performance, and competitive pricing established the model as an icon of the motoring world. The E-Type's claimed 150 mph (241 km/h) top speed, sub-7-second 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration, monocoque construction, disc brakes, rack-and-pinion steering, and independent front and rear suspension distinguished the car and spurred industry-wide changes </p>
<p>In 2004, Sports Car International magazine placed the E-Type at number one on their list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s. In March 2008, the Jaguar E-Type ranked first in The Daily Telegraph online list of the world's "100 most beautiful cars" of all time. Outside automotive circles, the E-type received prominent placement in Diabolik comic series, Austin Powers films and the television series Mad Men. </p>

<p>The Lamborghini Miura is a sports car produced by Italian automaker Lamborghini between 1966 and 1973. The car was the first supercar with a rear mid-engined two-seat layout, although the concept was first pioneered by René Bonnet with the Matra Djet in 1964. This layout has since become the standard for high-performance sports and supercars.When released, it was the fastest production road car. </p>
<p>The Miura won the prestigious Gran Turismo Trophy at the 2008 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, and has been re-created for use in the Gran Turismo 5 video game </p>

<h3><i>4.PORSCHE 911 </i></h3>

<p>The original Porsche 911 (pronounced nine eleven, German: Neunelfer) is a luxury sports car made by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany. The famous, distinctive, and durable design was introduced in autumn 1963 and built through 1989. It was succeeded by a modified version, internally referred to as Porsche 964 but still sold as Porsche 911, as are current models.</p>
<p>Mechanically, the 911 was notable for being rear engined and air-cooled. From its inception, the 911 was modified both by private teams and the factory itself for racing, rallying and other types of automotive competition. The original 911 series is often cited as the most successful competition car ever, especially when its variations are included, mainly the powerful 911-derived 935 which won 24 Hours of Le Mans and other major sports cars races outright against prototypes.</p>

<h3><i>5.ROLLS-ROYCE DAWN DROPHEAD </i></h3>

<p> Rolls-Royce made after the war, the original Silver Dawn drophead launched in 1949 and retired in 1954. The name was intended to mark the dawn of a new era for the world and Rolls-Royce's place in it. Slightly smaller than pre-war cars, the Dawn helped the British bespoke carmaker reintroduce motoring craftsmanship while bringing the company into the modern age.</p>
<p>The Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn is a full-size luxury car that was produced by Rolls-Royce at their Crewe works between 1949 and 1955. It was the first Rolls-Royce car to be offered with a factory built body which it shared, along with its chassis, with the Bentley Mark VI until 1952 and then the Bentley R Type until production finished in 1955. The car was first introduced as an export only model. The left hand drive manual transmission models had a column gear change, while right hand drives had a floor change by the door. Only with the R Type based model was it officially available on the home market, from October 1953. </p>

<h3><i>6.MERCEDES SL 300 GULLWING </i></h3>

<p>The success story continued in 1954 with the 300 SL “Gullwing”, a coupé that turned the heads of sports car enthusiasts with its unique design and extraordinary power. The roots of the car’s development lay in the USA: “What we need over here is a great Mercedes-Benz sports car,” US importer Maximilian Hoffman is reported to have said. In September 1953 he convinced the Board of Management at Daimler-Benz to build a series version of the successful 300 SL racing sports car. Incredibly, just five months later in  February 1954, the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL (W 198) made its sensational debut at the International Motor Sports Show in New York. The new sports car exuded elegance and innovation in equal measure. It was the world’s first four-stroke production passenger car to be equipped with output- and efficiency-enhancing direct fuel injection. </p>
<p>Breath-taking engine output of 215 hp (158 kW) provided a top speed of 250 km/h, depending on final drive ratio. That made the 300 SL the fastest production car of its day. As with the legendary racing sports car from the 1952 season, the vehicle featured consistent lightweight design throughout and a spaceframe that supported the engine, transmission and axles and left no room for conventional doors. </p>

<h3><i>7.FERRARI 250 GTO </i></h3>
<pic><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/01-bonhams-ferrari-monterey-2014-1.jpg/420px-01-bonhams-ferrari-monterey-2014-1.jpg "   style="width:40%; height:60%"   align="right"></pic>
<p>The model was built on a 2400 mm wheel base, as had been the 250 GT ‘SWB’ from which it was derived. Although the chassis was built along the same lines, it used smaller section tubing, with additional bracing for increased torsional rigidity, and was given factory type reference 539/62 Comp., and then 539/64 Comp. Like the earlier 250 GT ‘SWB’ Berlinettas, four wheel disc brakes were fitted, with a cable-operated handbrake to the rear wheels, and it was also available as both a left- and right-hand drive. </p>
<p>The 250 GTO Berlinettas continued the run of successes of the preceding ‘passo lungo’ and ‘passo corto’ models, and with the manufacturers’ championship being transferred to the GT category from 1962, gave Ferrari a hat trick of victories between 1962 and 1964. They were virtually dominant in their class, and were only being caught by the AC Cobras (with much larger capacity V8 engines) during their last competitive year. Amongst the numerous international successes of the 250 GTO were wins in the Tour de France in 1963 and 1964; GT class wins in the Targa Florio in 1962, 1963 and 1964; victories in the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood in 1962 and 1963; with GT category wins at Le Mans in 1962 and 1963, and in the Nurburgring 1000 km in 1963 and 1964. </p>

<p> The DB4 is a type of sports car that is designed for high speed and long-distance driving, due to a combination of performance and luxury attributes. The most common format is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive two-door coupé with either a two-seat or a 2+2 arrangement  that was produced by Aston Martin from 1958 until 1963..</p>
<p>A car with the British standard 3.54 final drive ratio tested by The Motor magazine in 1960 had a top speed of 139.3 mph (224.2 km/h) and could accelerate from 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 9.3 seconds. A fuel consumption of 17.7 miles per imperial gallon (16.0 L/100 km) was recorded.  </p>

<h3><i>9.BMW 3.0 CSL </i></h3>
<pic><img src="https://www.topgear.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_1858w/public/news-listicle/image/p0002893.jpg?itok=Hxxo-_OC "   style="width:40%; height:60%"   align="right"></pic>
<p>BMW created the 3.0 CSL out of a need to qualify the popular 3.0 CS for the European Touring Car Championship, producing 1,265 lightweight variants of the CS (the "L" in CSL standing for "leicht" or "light"). The car featured a massive 440-pound weight reduction courtesy of a new unibody built from thinner metal, a mixture of steel and aluminum body panels, and plexiglass side windows. Its most iconic feature, however, was the new aerodynamic package comprised of a large front air dam, front fender fins, and a huge rear wing with a supplementary roof spoiler. </p>
<p> Initially using the same engine as the 3.0 CS, the 3.0 CSL was given a very small increase in displacement to 3,003 cc (183.3 cu in) by increasing the engine bore by one quarter of a millimetre to 89.25 mm (3.51 in). This was done in August 1972 to allow the CSL to be raced in the "over three litre" racing category, allowing for some increase in displacement in the racing cars.In 1973, the engine in the 3.0 CSL was given another, more substantial increase in displacement to 3,153 cc (3.2 L; 192.4 cu in) by increasing the stroke to 84 mm (3.31 in), rated at 206 PS (203 hp; 152 kW) at 5600 rpm and 286 N⋅m (211 lb⋅ft) at 4200 rpm of torque . This final version of the 3.0 CSL was homologated in July 1973 along with an aerodynamic package including a large air dam, short fins running along the front fenders, a spoiler above and behind the trailing edge of the roof, and a tall rear wing. The rear wings were not installed at the factory, but were left in the boot for installation after purchase. This was done because the wings were illegal for use on German roads. The full aero package earned the racing CSLs the nickname "Batmobile".</p>

<h3><i>10.ACURA NSX </i></h3>

<p>The Honda NSX, marketed in North America as the Acura NSX, is a two-seat, mid-engine sports car manufactured by Honda. </p>
<p>The origins of the NSX trace back to 1984, with the HP-X (Honda Pininfarina eXperimental) concept, which was a mid-engined 3.0 L V6 engined rear wheel drive sports car. Honda committed to the project, with the intention of meeting or exceeding the performance of the then V8 engined Ferrari range, while offering reliability and a lower price point. The concept thus evolved and had its name changed to NS-X, which stood for "New", "Sportscar" "Unknown world" (the X was a reference to the mathematical symbol X, which stands for an unknown variable), although the production model was launched as the NSX. </p>
